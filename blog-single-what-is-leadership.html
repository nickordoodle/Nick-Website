                <p class="lead">Complex, real world problems are faced by individuals, teams, departments, corporations, the military and so many other types of organizations.  Problems can vary from fighting for your life or fighting for your company.  What happens in moments like these?  Leaders are put in the spotlight and need to make a decision, the right decision that is.  Let's discuss  what makes great Leaders.</p>
                
                <p>Since I would like this to be less objective than other blogs or articles that seem to confidently define the meaning of life, I will state that in my opinion; leaders are the individuals in a set of people that are looked up to, seeked out for their best guidance or judgement, the ones that can accurately assess the situation resulting in making an effective decision and will acknowledge their mistakes if the results are less than superb or expected.  More than anything else, Leaders have the ability to inspire others around them to accomplish a task, build a project or solve the world's next biggest problem.  Because the hidden message here is all major issues in society, war or business, are accomplished through teams.  If your team is not effective, then neither is your unit or your company.
                </p>

                <h2>Military Leadership</h2>

                <p>Numerous styles of leadership are seen in the military. From the outside, civilians may think that by default leaders, NCOs and Officers are respected and looked up to by nature of their rank or position. And anyone that has served can tell you this is far from the truth. That essentially translates into toxic leaders or leaders that are not respected constantly ordering their Soldiers to do something instead of inspiring them.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Do as I say, not as I do.</p></blockquote>

                <p>The military has countless rules and regulations to the extent where it is almost daunting.  It is expected that all Soldiers, regardless of rank or position abide by these rules and regulations unless otherwise specified.  But as predicted, you have the people that believe they are above the law.  Sometimes it is taking the easy way out or simply disagreeing with the regulation.  Due to their rank or position, they can get away with disobeying the rules in some instances.  However, what effect does this have on the team?  Well Soldiers see everything.  That is a fact.  They will either lose respect for you or emulate you and think it is okay to disobey what the military prescribed.  So at some point the phrase "Do as I say, not as I do" has been born and there are extremely prevalent reasons backing this saying.</p>

                <h3>Underlying Principles that make Successful Leaders and Managers</h3>

                <p>Leaders outline what needs to be done and how he or she thinks we will get there.  Managers do not know all of the answers, hence why a team exists.  There are some characteristics that always make a more effective Manager.


                <p>Leaders are....</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>superb at synching the end goal of the project while maximizing the effective employment of the team. </li>
                    <li>right, a lot.</li>
                    <li>able to utilize transparency in their language and interactions.  The Why is given along with tactful feedback. </li>
                    <li>respectful, possess an unquestionable amount of trust and have character.</li>
                    <li>empower their employees, and consistently give credit to their team.</li>
                    <li>listeners.. They realize that five brains are better than one.</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>Leaders and Managers should be doing their best to write themselves out of a job.</h2>
