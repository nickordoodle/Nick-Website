                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>Who is this guy Nick?<br>

                    I am a Software Engineer and Army Veteran.<br>I love to network and be a part of the next big thing in technology.</h3>


                <p class="textblock">I strive to serve others through the means of developing software that has a positive impact on everyday lives.
                    A little more..
                    <br><br>
                    Graduated from Rutgers University - New Brunswick with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Ten days after graduation, I commissioned as an Active Duty Infantry Officer and served in the Army for about three years
                    <br><br>

                    Where do I see myself in the future?
                    Life is weird...but ideally a mid level Software Engineer that is always networking and learning about the industry while constantly striving to deliver a robust, scalable, modular solution to real world problems that people face worldwide. That is one part of my imagination. The other, more abstract and distinct but still relevant...a determined businessman in some type of mid to senior level operations overseeing numerous projects at a time in whatever industry the world sees fit for me.
